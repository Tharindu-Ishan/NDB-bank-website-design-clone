# NDB Bank Design Clone

The NDB Bank Design Clone project is a static website built with HTML and CSS. It closely resembles the look and feel of the NDB Bank search page, including the logo, search bar, buttons, and overall styling.

Please note that this clone project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not include any real search functionality or backend integration with the NDB Bank search engine.

This is done by me to practice html,css
